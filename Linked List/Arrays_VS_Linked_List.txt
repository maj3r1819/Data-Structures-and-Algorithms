In Linked List Elements are independent objects.
In Arrays Elements are not independent objects.

When we delete an element in Array, they array will still occupy that memory.
In linked list we can delete any element and memory will also be re usable

In linked list, size is not defined, it can be incremented and reduced anytime(Variable size)
In arrays size of the array is fixed.

Insertion and removals are very efficient in Linked list.
Whereas in arrays, we have to move the elements to one side which is inefficient.

Finding an element in  linked list is time consuming.
Finding index of an element known in an array has time complexity of O(1)
